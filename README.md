Miscellaneous data and software projects that I'm currently working on at Napleton Automotive.

# Project Descriptions
## pull_data.py
Relatively simply python program to connect to custom built Node.js API and pull data using requests. The goal was to gain proficiency in collecting and normalizing data in order to prepare it for visualization with Matplotlib or other graphing libraries. Another goal in this project was to get better at optimizing functions and error handling.
